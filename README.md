## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Kamyar Ehsani ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a freshman Computer Science major at the University of Texas at San Antonio with a strong interest in machine learning and data analysis. Over the summer, I dedicated my time to learning key tools and libraries like Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly. Although Iâ€™m still building my confidence with these technologies, Iâ€™m eager to gain more experience and deepen my understanding of them.

Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. The idea of turning data into meaningful insights and seeing how algorithms can learn and improve over time is what drives my interest. I love the challenge of tackling new concepts, experimenting with different techniques, and continuously expanding my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.

As I progress in my studies and career, Iâ€™m committed to learning from each experience and continuously improving.

## Areas of Focus

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**

  I have experience working with Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly to handle data analysis and create visualizations. While Iâ€™m still developing my skills, Iâ€™m comfortable working with data to extract insights and present them visually.

- **Data Management**

  Iâ€™m familiar with managing data through databases, querying, aggregation, analysis, and visualization. Although Iâ€™m still learning, Iâ€™m capable of handling various aspects of the data lifecycle.

- **Collaboration and Communication**

  Iâ€™m a proactive problem solver who enjoys working with others. I can communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences, and Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on projects and learn from the experience.

- **Analytical Skills**

  I possess strong analytical skills, which I apply to data analysis and problem-solving. While Iâ€™m still growing in this area, Iâ€™m capable of using data to identify and address issues.

## Experience

- **Upcoming Research Participation**

  *University of Texas at San Antonio*
Starting August 2024

  I will be participating in a research project at the University of Texas at San Antonio focused on Responsible Data Science for Social Good. The research will cover topics such as addressing societal challenges through data-driven techniques, learning with limited labeled data, and algorithmic fairness. This course aims to help students, including myself, gain deeper knowledge and research experience in these crucial areas.

## Personal Projects

- **Alien Invasion Game**
  Overview:
Alien Invasion is a 2D shooter game developed in Python. The objective of the game is to defend the Earth from waves of alien spacecraft by controlling a spaceship and shooting down the invaders. The player earns points for each alien destroyed and progresses through increasingly difficult levels.

Technical Details:

- Language: Python
- Libraries Used: Pygame for game development, which handles the rendering of graphics, sound effects, and user input.
- Game Features:
-  Player Controls: The player can move the spaceship horizontally and shoot bullets to destroy the incoming aliens.
-  Scoring System: Players earn points for each alien they successfully destroy, with the score displayed on the screen.
-  Level Progression: As players clear waves of aliens, the game advances to higher levels with increasing difficulty, such as   faster alien movement and more complex patterns.
- Collision Detection: Implemented to detect and handle collisions between bullets and aliens, as well as between aliens and   the playerâ€™s spaceship.
- Game Over Condition: The game ends when an alien collides with the playerâ€™s spaceship or reaches the bottom of the screen.

Challenges:
During development, I faced challenges related to optimizing performance as the number of entities on the screen increased, as well as fine-tuning the collision detection system to ensure smooth gameplay.

Relevance:
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and Pygame, as well as my ability to handle the complexities of game development. It also reflects my skills in problem-solving, project management, and attention to detail.
