## About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m Kamyar Ehsani ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a freshman Computer Science major at the University of Texas at San Antonio with a strong interest in machine learning and data analysis. Over the summer, I dedicated my time to learning key tools and libraries like Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly. Although Iâ€™m still building my confidence with these technologies, Iâ€™m eager to gain more experience and deepen my understanding of them.

Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. The idea of turning data into meaningful insights and seeing how algorithms can learn and improve over time is what drives my interest. I love the challenge of tackling new concepts, experimenting with different techniques, and continuously expanding my knowledge in this rapidly evolving field.

As I progress in my studies and career, Iâ€™m committed to learning from each experience and continuously improving.
